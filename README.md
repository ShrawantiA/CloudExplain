# CloudExplain
Dashboard prototype for visualising explanations of AI-driven operations.

## Overview
This PoC creates a simple interactive dashboard for exploring reliability
and interpretability metrics in AI-based operational automation.

Developed as preliminary work for the University of Manchester MPhil project:
**"Towards Explainable and Reliable AI-Driven Operations"**

## Structure
- `/dashboard/` - Streamlit app prototype
- `/data/` - future input datasets

## Next Steps
1. Integrate outputs from LogTrust-XAI and PyReason-Ops.
2. Display trust and reliability scores.
3. Add SHAP and logic-rule visualisations.
